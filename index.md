Hello, my name is *Bas Beeuwsaert*. I am a transfer student to UCSD currently finishing the **Spring Quarter** of my **Junior** year.
As a programmer, I agree with the quote by the programmer Chris Pine (not that one) which goes,
> Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.
I believe programming isn't simply taking what you know, and applying it. Much of programming involves figuring out the gaps in your knowledge and how your current way of thinking might be flawed. I plan on using `GitHub` for my projects, most of which will most likely be in written my favorite programming language ([Favorite Programming Language](README.md))

My favorite things to do in no particular order is:
- Hike With Friends
- Play Games With Friends
- Read

I also thoroughly enjoy food. My favorite things to eat in order are:
1. Spaghetti Carbonara
2. Fresh Homemade Oven Baked Pizza
3. KBBQ

These are challenging times for everyone, so here is a cool cat to cheer you up. ![Image of Cool Cat](https://github.com/basbelg/Github-Pages/blob/main/spare%20pictures/Cool%20Cat.jpg)
